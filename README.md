# Manga Scraper
Random fun project from js beginner, I was annoyed buy the continous ads popping up. So decided to write a small tool to download the manga and read it locally instead.

### How does it work?
It's simply a image scraper that scrapes the images from the website/downloads them and generates an index.htm file which the user opens to read the manga.

## Issues
- Works only with a single site template, add support for more site templates.
- Code cleanup/optimizations.
