# Manga Scraper
Random fun project from js beginner, I was annoyed buy the continous ads popping up. So decided to write a small tool to download the manga and read it locally instead.

### How does it work?
It's simply a image scraper that scrapes the images from the website/downloads them and generates and index.htm file to read it conveniently.

## Issues
- Failing to recognize Double digits or more in page number. Can be fixed by splitting by '-' instead of taking last char of url.
